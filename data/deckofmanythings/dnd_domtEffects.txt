Balance: {name} must change to a radically different alignment. If they fail to act according to the new alignment, {name} gains a negative level.
Comet: {name} must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered. If successful, {name} gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. If they don't do it entirely by themselves, the benefit is lost.
Donjon: All gear and spells are stripped from {name}. This card signifies imprisonment - either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. Draw no more cards.
Euryale: {name} suffers a -1 on all of their saving throws. The medusa-like visage of this card brings this curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The curse on {name} is otherwise permanent.
Fates: This card enables {name} to avoid any situation they choose ... once. They can avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. This card, however, does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for {name}; other party members may have to endure the situation.
Flames: There is now emnity between {name} and an outsider. Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks {name} (or plagues their life in some way) within 1d20 days.
Fool: {name} loses 10,000 XP, and draws again. The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is discarded when drawn.
Gem: This card indicates wealth. {name} gains either 25 pieces of jewelry, or 50 gems. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp; the gems 1,000 gp value each.
Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence from {name} immediately.
Jester: {name} gains 10,000 XP and two more draws. This card is discarded.
Key: {name} gains a major magic weapon. The magic weapon granted must be one usable by {name}. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in their hand.
Knight: {name} gains the service of a 4th-level fighter. The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as {name}.
Moon: {name} is granted 1d4 wishes. This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full/four; gibbous/three; half/two; quarter/one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.
Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of {name}'s NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If {name} has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.
Ruin: All of {name}'s nonmagical wealth and real property is lost, as implied by this card's name.
Skull: A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. {name} must fight it alone - if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If {name} is slain, they are slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle.
Star: {name} immediately gains a +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. The 2 points are added to any ability {name} chooses; they cannot be divided among two abilities.
Sun: {name} gains a random medium wondrous item, and 50,000 XP.
Talons: Every magic item owned or possessed by {name} is instantly and irrevocably gone.
Throne: {name} becomes a true leader in people's eyes and gains a +6 bonus on Diplomacy checks, as well as a small keep. The keep appears in any open area {name} wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).
Vizier: This card empowers {name} with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon their request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely.
Void: This black card spells instant disaster. {name}'s body continues to function, as though comatose, but their psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere - in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring {name} back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.
